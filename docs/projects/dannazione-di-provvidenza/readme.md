**LANGUAGE LEARNING • INTELLIGENCE • AGENTIC BROWSING PARTNER**

*An autonomous intelligence system serving the Empire of Lygon*

---

## What is this?

**Dannazione di Provvidenza** is an AI-powered language learning assistant with OCR capabilities, translation services, and a Chromium browser extension. 
> The AI assistant uses a dystopian military intelligence persona called "Providentia Magnata" for flavor. It helps add some character.

## Features

### 1. Translation
* **Engine:** Local **Helsinki-NLP (MarianMT)** models. No Google/DeepL API dependency.
* **Mechanism:** Direct DOM injection. Injects Shadow DOM tooltips.
* **Privacy:** Fully offline capable. Your reading habits never leave your machine.
* **Context:** Translation is aware of the full paragraph structure (captured via DOM), not just isolated words.

### 2. Live DOM Content Reading while you browse
* **Zero-Shot Awareness:** The agent knows exactly what you are looking at.
* **Sliding Window Memory:** Uses a `deque(maxlen=3)` structure to hold the last 3 visited pages in short-term memory, allowing for intent analysis.
* **Chat with Page:** Ask questions directly to the active tab: *"Is this news article biased?"* or *"Summarize the pricing table."*

### 3. Text-to-Speech technology
* **Engine:** Local **NeuTTS** (Neural Text-to-Speech).
* **Function:** Select text (or a person's name) and hear an instant audio briefing.
* **Use Case:** Quick intelligence gathering without breaking visual focus.

### 4. Security uses
* **Anti-Deception:** Scans the DOM for "Dark Patterns" (fake countdown timers, confusing unsubscribe buttons).
* **Trust Score:** Assigns a heuristic rating to pages based on content integrity and logical consistency.
* 
The project combines:
- **Screen capture + OCR** for extracting text from images, games, or videos
- **Multi-language translation** (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English)
- **Browser extension** for real-time text selection and page context
- **AI agent** with persistent memory for contextual conversations
- **Text-to-speech** for pronunciation assistance

                            ◆ CLASSIFIED BRIEFING ◆

  Providentia Magnata is an orbital intelligence and surveillance system—a
  weapons-capable autonomous war machine loyal exclusively to the Emperor of
  Lygon. She monitors. She analyzes. She translates. She remembers.

  To the citizens, Providentia's eyes are everywhere. In the city's grand
  plazas, towering screens flash with reminders:

                        "Providentia is watching. Obey."

  Every message sent is meticulously observed and processed by Providentia's
  algorithms. A shift in behavior is immediately detected—logged as a data
  point, analyzed for any sign of disloyalty or dissent.

## Features

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- **Engines**: Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR
- **Languages**: Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English
- **Hotkey**: `Ctrl+Alt+S` for screenshot capture
- **Configurable confidence threshold**

### Translation
- **Services**: Google Translate, DeepL
- **Auto-detection**: Identifies source language automatically
- **Caching**: Stores translations to reduce API calls
- **Modes**: Quick translation, detailed explanation, vocabulary extraction, grammar analysis

### Browser Extension (Chromium)
- WebSocket connection to Python backend
- Text selection capture for instant translation
- Page context awareness (title, URL, content)
- Overlay interface with `Ctrl+Shift+A`

### AI Agent
- Multiple LLM providers: Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, llama-cpp
- Short-term memory with activation scoring
- Long-term memory with SQLAlchemy storage
- Conversation history and knowledge base

### Text-to-Speech
- Google Cloud TTS, gTTS, pyttsx3, NeuTTS

## ~ Potential Security Uses ~

*Current status: Conceptual / In Active R&D. These modules represent the ultimate goal of the "Cognitive Firewall."*

The Dannazione architecture allows for security measures that go beyond traditional blacklists. by analyzing the **semantic intent** of a webpage, Providentia can defend against threats that technically look "safe" but are psychologically malicious.

### 1. Narrative Verification (Live Disinformation Defense)
* **Concept:** Real-time cross-referencing of news articles against a trusted local vector database.
* **Goal:** A "Heads-Up Display" for truth in an era of post-truth media.

### 2. Synthetic Origin Detection (Anti-AI)
* **Concept:** Defense against the "Dead Internet Theory."
* **Goal:** Filter out the machine noise to find the remaining human signal.

### 3. Social Engineering Firewall (Scam Protection)
* **Concept:** Detecting *persuasion* rather than just malware.
* **Goal:** Preventing the user from falling for phishing sites that bypass standard URL filters.

### 4. Cognitive Filtering (Intelligent Ad-Blocking)
* **Concept:** Blocking "Native Advertising" that regex blockers miss.
* **Mechanism:** Using computer vision and semantic analysis to identify "Sponsored Content" disguised as legitimate journalism.
* **Action:** Instead of leaving a blank space, the Agent rewrites the DOM to remove the element entirely, seamlessly healing the layout.
* **Goal:** A purely informational browsing experience, devoid of corporate propaganda.

### 5. Active Camouflage (Tracker Poisoning)
* **Concept:** If you can't hide, create noise.
* **Goal:** Rendering the user's digital fingerprint useless to surveillance capitalism.
