Providentia Network is a Django-based backend that orchestrates multi-branch reasoning with Google's Gemini models, a native C++ co-processor, and optional visualisations of the thought graph. This document summarises the current architecture and provides the commands needed to build and run the system locally.

 Yao et el. (2023) and Long (2023)

recently proposed Tree of Thoughts (ToT), a framework that generalizes over chain-of-thought prompting and encourages exploration over thoughts that serve as intermediate steps for general problem solving with language models.

ToT maintains a tree of thoughts, where thoughts represent coherent language sequences that serve as intermediate steps toward solving a problem. This approach enables an LM to self-evaluate the progress through intermediate thoughts made towards solving a problem through a deliberate reasoning process. The LM's ability to generate and evaluate thoughts is then combined with search algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search and depth-first search) to enable systematic exploration of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Data Flow

```
Client -> /speech/simple_response (Django REST view)
      -> Python ThinkingManager (speech/context_manager/ThinkingManager.py)
      -> C++ “Kievan Rus” thinker (speech/context_manager/Kievan Rus/*.cpp)
      -> Gemini API (JSON over HTTPS)
      -> Binary payload (status + context + summary)
      -> Python deserialiser & branch expansion
      -> Optional PNG graph (speech/context_manager/graphs/)
      -> Django response text
```

### Core Components

- **Django REST Endpoint (`speech/views.py`)**  
  Accepts a user prompt, instantiates a `ThinkingManager`, and forwards the final instruction text returned by the agent.

- **Python Thinking Manager (`speech/context_manager/ThinkingManager.py`)**  
  Maintains the thought tree and enforces architectural rules:
  - Spawns the native C++ helper as a subprocess with the current message, branch label, and iteration metadata.
  - Parses the binary response (1 byte status, 4 byte lengths, UTF-8 payloads) and validates the JSON against `ContextStruct` (Pydantic).
  - Records per-branch `probability_of_success`, incremental `potential_score`, `possible_setbacks`, and branch labels.
  - Guarantees at least two branch explorations per level and aggregates a cumulative potential score.
  - Emits a textual tree and optionally renders a PNG diagram (see below).

- **C++ “Kievan Rus” Thinker (`speech/context_manager/Kievan Rus/`)**  
  Modularised into headers/sources for argument parsing, environment loading, Gemini HTTP calls (libcurl), prompt construction, and binary serialisation.
  - Reads the Gemini API key from the process environment or `.env`.
  - Issues two Gemini requests: one for structured analysis, one for narrative summary.
  - Encodes the structured context and summary into a portable binary format consumed by Python.
  - The root Makefile target `build-thinker` recompiles the module (g++17, `-lcurl`) and is chained automatically when running the server.

- **Graph Rendering (`plotting/graphing.py`)**  
  Uses Matplotlib (Agg backend) to visualise the final thought tree. Each node includes branch label, wrapped plan text, probabilities, per-step potential deltas, cumulative potential, and highlights for “final” or “regretted” states. Images land in `speech/context_manager/graphs/`.

- **Gemini Agent (`speech/gemini/agent.py`)**  
  Lightweight wrapper around Google’s `genai` client. The C++ module mirrors this functionality for latency-critical reasoning.

### Branching & Scoring Semantics

- `ThinkingManager` keeps the tree depth bounded (`max_iterations = 8`) yet ensures every node spawns at least two labelled branches (e.g., `Primary-A`, `Primary-B`) unless capped by the iteration limit.
- Each branch carries:
  - `probability_of_success` — float clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]`.
  - `potential_score` — signed delta added to `cumulative_potential`.
  - `possible_setbacks` — textual risk assessment embedded into logs, console output, and visualisations.
- Logs are emitted for every branch spawn, numeric evaluation, and graph rendering step to ease debugging.

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 (a virtualenv or Conda environment is recommended).
- `g++` with C++17 support and development headers for libcurl.
- Access to a Gemini API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) placed in `.env` or the process environment.
- (Optional) Matplotlib for PNG graph generation; without it the system logs a warning and skips plotting.

### Environment Creation

```bash
make update              # uses environment.yml via conda/micromamba
```

Override defaults:

```bash
make update CONDA_ENV=my-env-name
make update ENV_FILE=envs/dev.yml
make update CONDA=~/.local/bin/micromamba
```

### Building & Running

```bash
make run                 # recompiles the C++ thinker then runs `python manage.py runserver`
```

Standalone compilation (if needed):

```bash
make build-thinker       # cd speech/context_manager/Kievan\ Rus && g++ ... -lcurl
```

The server expects `.env` at the project root unless `KIEVAN_RUS_ENV_PATH` is set.

### Common Make Targets

| Target              | Description                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `make run`          | Build C++ helper and start Django dev server              |
| `make migrate`      | Run migrations (`makemigrations` + `migrate`)             |
| `make prepare`      | Create Conda env from `environment.yml`                   |
| `make update`       | Update/create Conda env with pruning                      |
| `make build-thinker`| Recompile the C++ reasoning module                        |
| `make help`         | List available targets (if defined in Makefile)          |

Use `PY=...` to point at a specific interpreter, or override `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` as needed.

## Configuration Notes

- `.env`  
  ```
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
  # optional Django settings...
  ```

- `KIEVAN_RUS_ENV_PATH` (environment variable) can override the `.env` location for the C++ process.
- Graphs are written to `speech/context_manager/graphs/thought_graph_<root-id>.png`. Remove the directory to clean up artefacts.

---

## Testing & Debugging Tips

- The binary protocol is strict; malformed responses from Gemini (e.g., missing `text` fields) raise clear exceptions logged by both Python and C++ layers.
- Branch creation, probability calculations, and graph rendering all log detailed progress via `[ThinkingManager]` prefixes. Watch the Django console during development to track the reasoning flow.
- If Matplotlib is missing, the system continues without PNG output but logs the import failure.

Providentia Network’s backend is designed for iterative experimentation: update the prompts, adjust scoring heuristics, or extend the binary format as needed. `make run` keeps the C++ helper in sync so you can focus on the reasoning logic. Happy hacking!
