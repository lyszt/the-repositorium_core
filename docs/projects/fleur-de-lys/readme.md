*"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, first invent the universe." -- Carl Sagan*

## Disk Layout

The image uses a GPT partition table:

| Partition | Size | Filesystem | Label            |
|-----------|------|------------|------------------|
| p1        | 10G  | F2FS       | Fleur_de_Lys_Root    |
| p2        | 20G  | bcachefs   | Fleur_de_Lys_Sources |
| p3        | 10G  | bcachefs   | Fleur_de_Lys_Home    |

## Prerequisites

A Linux host with the following available:

- `losetup`, `mount`, `chroot` (util-linux)
- F2FS and bcachefs filesystem support (`f2fs-tools`, `bcachefs-tools`)
- Standard development toolchain (gcc, g++, make, binutils, etc.)

Run `bash tests/version-check.sh` to verify your host has the required tools.

## Usage

All commands require root privileges.

```
sudo make mount       # Attach the image and mount partitions into mnt_image/
sudo make run         # Mount + bind virtual filesystems + enter chroot shell
sudo make umount      # Unmount everything and detach the loop device
```

## Building the Image from Scratch

To create a new blank disk image (20 GB) with the partition table and formatted filesystems:

```
sudo bash scripts/build_os.sh
```

## Project Structure

```
Fleur_de_Lys.img      # The disk image
mnt_image/            # Mount point (created by make mount)
Makefile              # Mount, run, and unmount targets
docker/               # Multi-stage Docker build environment
  Dockerfile          # Stage 1 & 2 build layers
  engine/             # Build scripts (fleur-build.sh, etc.)
  recipes/            # Software build instructions by stage
etc/
  os-release          # Distribution identity
scripts/
  build_os.sh         # Create and partition a new disk image
  build_img.sh        # Image creation helper
  mount.sh            # Legacy mount script
tests/
  version-check.sh    # Verify host toolchain requirements
```

## Docker Toolchain Environment

The toolchain and intermediate system tools are constructed using a multi-stage Docker build:

- **Stage 1 (toolchain-builder):** Bootstraps the compiler (gcc/clang), binutils, and glibc.
- **Stage 2 (temp-tools-builder):** Builds all cross-compiled utilities (bash, coreutils, python, meson, ninja, etc.) into `/tools`.

To build the toolchain environment:

```bash
cd docker
make build
```
